## Reactit: Upvote & dynamic sorting app

This simple React app lets a user upvote or downvote "posts" (counter1, counter2, & counter3) and then dynamically sorts them according to vote tally count. This is a scaled back version of a Reddit like content display system, but with hard coded posts and no ability to submit or delete.

#### Installation

Clone repository, `npm install`, `npm run start`

#### Known bugs/issues

Still learning to use locally hosted images in Webpack; current build requires internet connection to pull hotlinked images from DropBox.

By nature of dynamic resorting, UI is hard to use. Consider it egalitarian in that upvoting the lowest post or downvoting the top post will lead naturally to sharing of votes.
