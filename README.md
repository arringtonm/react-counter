## Reactit: Upvote & dynamic sorting app

This simple React app lets a user upvote or downvote "posts" (counter1, counter2, & counter3) and then dynamically resorts them accordingly. This is a scaled down version of a Reddit like content display system, but with hard coded posts and no ability to submit or delete.
